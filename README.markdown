# JS Calculator

Fully functional calculator built in React.  Enforces logical rules around user input, such as:
  -  Expression must start with a number, ., or negative sign 
  -  Expression cannot contain two operators in a row (with the exception of a minus sign)
  -  A number can only contain a single decimal point
  -  Pressing a number immediately following = should start a new calculation
  -  Pressing an operator immediately following = should start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation
  -  Handles > 5 decimal places of precision with rounding, indicated by ~ symbol
